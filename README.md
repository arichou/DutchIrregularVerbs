# Dutch Irregular Verbs

I was learning Dutch for a bit there, and this was to help me practice the irregular verb conjugations, and to help me find patterns in the different vowel patterns, for easier memorization.

I'm pretty sure I broke the search featuer while making improvements, and then stopped learning Dutch, therefore never getting back to fixing the search feature. But it's a nice chunk of code to look at, and I built it from scratch.
